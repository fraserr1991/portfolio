        <p>I'm Fraser, I am new to the tech field. I recently invested into a CodeClan course to expand my understanding of the field. In my time at CodeClan I've explored a variety of languages and used those to create projects. After my time at CodeClan I hope to explore a wide range of topics before going deeper into a more specific topic.</p>
